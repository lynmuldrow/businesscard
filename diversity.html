      <!-- Hi! Thanks for looking at my code. It's kinda messy, but gets the job done! This is not something I would consider ready for production- indents are off, it's not clean, and classes were replicated for time. I built this in a few hours on Sunday. I used HTML, CSS, Normalize, and Materialize. I'm still learning material design but I really like it! Thanks so much for considering me. <3 -->

          <div class="col s12 m8 l9"><p>Diversity Specialist Task</p>

            <div class="googletext">
              I'd really like to be considered for this position, and have created a mock task to show how I'd innovate using data stories to bring ideas into fruition and make an impact for the Googler community. To learn more about me, visit the <a href="google.html">fact sheet.</a>
            </div>

              <h2>The Idea</h2>

            <div class="googletext">
              The Black Googler Network would like to impact success for Black women startups across the country. BGN would like to pilot a program to invest a small portion of their salary monthly that is collated into a company pool and sent to deserving entrepreneurs. 
            </div>

          
          
          <h2>The Task</h2>

            <div class="googletext">
               The Diversity Strategist is tasked with researching the funding idea, pulling relevant data, and presenting this idea to stakeholders for project implementation. 
            </div>

        </div>

          <h2>Initial Thoughts/Brainstorming</h2>

          <div class="googletext">
             As a Diversity Strategist, this idea excites me. Given what I've read of the abysmal funding numbers for black women founders, the concept of Googlers using their own incomes to fund experiences that speak to diverse thought and ingenuity is powerful and would resonate in the media.

            <br/><br/>

              After lightly searching (Google, of course), it appears that there is not much data that exists on the prevalence and traction of products/companies led by black women founders. I expect to find it difficult to collate topical information, but we can use resources available currently and develop more. 

            <br/><br/>

              I believe that the clearest path to execution for this project would be to collate data for the <strong>why-</strong> I'll seek data that explains why the BGN should invest in this demographic. Next, it makes sense to collate data on projects that currently have a medium-high reception rate currently and is active on social media. Finally, I'll pull together a quick presentation that presents these findings, and speak about how to implement.

          </div>


           <h2>Gathering Data</h2>

          <div class="googletext">
             First, I wanted to speak to the <em>why</em> of the project. So as not to reinvent the wheel, I searched for relevant datasets that would address why black women founders are so underfunded, and how we could help. I found that <a href="http://www.projectdiane.com/">#ProjectDiane</a> has a great, tangible set of data points that I could use for my presentation: 

             <blockquote>To date, 138 founders have been submitted to Project Diane, only 11 of which received more than $100,000 in investment money. Finney stresses that the data-gathering process is still in its early stages, but nonetheless acknowledges that the findings thus far are "extremely troubling." According to her initial math, less than .1% of all venture funding deals involve startups founded by black women.</blockquote> 

             <br/><br/>

             Next, I used Google Sheets with the Blockspring add-on to pull a small list of black founders from Angelist and Product Hunt with their information (I understand that more extensive data would be required), and cross-referenced with their engagement levels on social media: 

             <br/>
             <div class="row">
              <div class="col s12 m8 l9"><img src="images/startup1.png" class="responsive-img me"></div>
              <div class="col s12 m8 l9"><img src="images/startup2.png" class="responsive-img me"></div>
              <div class="col s12 m8 l9"><img src="images/startup3.png" class="responsive-img me"></div>
            </div>

             <br/><br/>
            
            Given that most are startups, I found it hard to look at the data for engagement based on social metrics alone, because many of them aren't firmly planted as yet. I took a more holistic look at the entrepreneurs by performing a user search across social media platforms, assessing their background and product viability. I found that GirlTrek was the most successful on the black women founder list, achieving a large seed round, but there were other startups with more tenured entrepreneurs. Stuck in a bit of a loop, I researched VC firms to see how the process is done, to add to the presentation. I thought it might be better to have the BGN decide through vote once a list of potential candidates was produced, and if I were presenting this fully, I'd have a fact sheet prepared for each of the potential entrepreneurs and startups. 

          </div>

          <h2>Googler Investments</h2>

            <div class="googletext">
               How much should a Googler invest? What would be the return? This is where I'd seek help from my fellow Googlers. I think it would be wise to analyze a specific percentage point that could be deducted from the participants' salary per month, to achieve a contribution max that could be donated. Because salaries and contribution levels are sensitive, I'd consult with <a href="http://www.googlecapital.com/">Google Capital</a> and gain insight to add to the project. 
            </div>


          <h2>Pulling it Together</h2>

          <div class="googletext">
            Given the facts gained from Project Diane/Digital Undivided on supporting black women founders, the metrics gleamed after obtaining a current list of black women founders, and the information learned from Google Capital, I was able to create a small presentation:
